# Orange Money SDK

> **Disclaimer:** This is not an official SDK from Orange. This is a side project created to simplify Orange Money Web Payment integration. Ensure compliance with Orange Money's terms of service.

An easy-to-use SDK for integrating Orange Money Web Payment in your applications.

---

## Overview

This SDK allows you to create Orange Money payment links seamlessly by handling authentication and request signing. It requires you to provide your own Orange Money credentials and configure URLs for payment flow and notifications.

---

## Prerequisites

Before using the SDK, you must have an Orange Money developer account and obtain the following credentials from Orange Money:

- **BASIC_TOKEN**: Your OAuth basic authentication token (for the initial token request)
- **TOKEN_URL**: URL to request OAuth access token (usually `https://api.orange.com/oauth/v1/token`)
- **merchantKey**: Your merchant secret key used to sign requests
- **paymentUrl**: URL to create payment requests (usually `https://api.orange.com/orange-money-webpay/dev/v1/webpayment`)

| `merchantKey` | `string`| Your merchant secret key used to sign payment requests                                          |
| `orderId`     | `string`| Unique identifier for each payment transaction                                                  |
| `totalPrice`  | `number`| Amount to be paid (in the smallest currency unit, e.g., cents)                                 |
| `returnUrl`   | `string`| URL where customers are redirected after a successful payment                                   |
| `cancelUrl`   | `string`| URL where customers are redirected after cancelling a payment                                   |
| `notifUrl`    | `string`| Backend URL where Orange Money sends asynchronous payment notifications       

> **Important:** The `notifUrl` is crucial for receiving asynchronous transaction results. Make sure it is publicly accessible and secured.                   |

## Installation

### Download the pre-built SDK

You can download the `dist/` directory from the repository and copy it directly into your project. This contains the pre-built SDK files.

Import it in your code as:

```ts
import { OrangeMoney } from './dist';
```

### Clone the full repository (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sorybarry223/timilo.git
cd timilo
npm install
npm run build
```

After building, use the `dist/` directory or link the package locally.


---

## Usage Example

```ts
import { OrangeMoney } from './dist';

const sdk = new OrangeMoney({
  basicToken: 'your_basic_token_here',
  tokenUrl: 'https://api.orange.com/oauth/v1/token',
  paymentUrl: 'https://api.orange.com/orange-money-webpay/dev/v1/webpayment',
});

async function testPayment() {
  try {
    const result = await sdk.createPaymentLink({
      merchantKey: 'your_merchant_key',
      orderId: 'ORDER_001',         // Must be unique for each transaction
      totalPrice: 1000,             // Amount in smallest currency unit
      returnUrl: 'https://example.com/success',
      cancelUrl: 'https://example.com/cancel',
      notifUrl: 'https://example.com/notify',
    });

    console.log('‚úÖ Payment link:', result.payment_url);
    console.log('üîî Notification token:', result.notif_token);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Error:', error);
  }
}

testPayment();
```

## Important Notes

- **Unique orderId**: Each transaction must have a unique `orderId`. Reusing it results in errors such as HTTP 403 Forbidden.

- **Notification URL (notifUrl)**: This URL must be publicly accessible for Orange Money to send payment status notifications.

- **Keep credentials secure**: Never expose your `merchantKey`, `basicToken`, or other sensitive information in public repositories.

- **Token Management**: The SDK handles OAuth token requests and refreshes automatically. Ensure the tokens and URLs remain valid.

- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully when calling SDK methods.
